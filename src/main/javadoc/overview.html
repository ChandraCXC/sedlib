      <p>The SED Library allows serialization and deserialization of Spectral Energy Distribution files according to the
        <a href="http://ivoa.net/Documents/cover/SpectrumDM-20071029.html">IVOA Spectrum Data Model v1.03.</a></p>

      <p>
          This is a development version of the SED library and is a work in
          progress.  It's interfaces and functionality are subject to change.
      </p>

      <p>The currently supported serialization formats are VOTable and FITS. XML serialization might be included in future versions.</p>

      <p>A Spectral Energy Distribution is represented by the {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.Sed} class. In the current implementation, this class provides methods to access
        and manipulate a list of {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.Segment} objects, each segment being the representation of a Spectrum or a collection of Photometry points.</p>

      <p>A {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.Sed} object can be read from a file using the {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.io.SedIOFactory}. For example, the following code
          reads the <code>sample.vot</code> VOTable from disk:</p>

      <pre><code>
      Sed doc;

	try
	{
	    ISedDeserializer deserializer = SedIOFactory.createDeserializer( SedFormat.VOT );
	    doc = deserializer.deserialize( "sample.vot" );
	}
	catch ( Exception exp )
	{
	   /* ... handle exception ... */
	}
      </code></pre>

      On the other hand, to write the {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.Sed} object <code>sed</code> to disk in a given {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.io.SedFormat}, e.g. VOTable:

      <pre><code>
      try
	{
	    ISedSerializer serializer = SedIOFactory.createSerializer( SedFormat.VOT );
	    serializer.serialize( "sample.vot", sed );
	}
	catch ( Exception exp )
	{
	    /* ... handle exception ... */
	}
      </code></pre>


      <p>The library also provides a collection of Java classes that map to the
        datatypes defined in the schema.</p>

      <p>SED documents (in various file
        formats) can be read by the library and the corresponding Java objects
        instantianted.  These objects can then be modified as desired - which
        is equivalent to editing the document - and the results written as a
        modified document.  The library API can also be used to create
        documents by instantiating the appropriate Java objects
        directly.
      </p>

        <p>
        The library can be used to transform SED documents from one file
        format to another by reading the document, which builds the
        appropriate Java
        object(s) and then writing it out in another format.
        </p>
        <p>
        The API also provides access to the spectral data in a document. This
        permits, for example, plotting of the data, statistical analysis of
        multiple spectra, or fitting theoretical models to the data.
