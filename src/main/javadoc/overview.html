      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The SED Library allows serialization and deserialization of Spectral Energy Distribution files according to the
        <a href="http://ivoa.net/Documents/cover/SpectrumDM-20071029.html">IVOA Spectrum Data Model v1.03.</a></p>

      <p>
          This is a development version of the SED library and is a work in
          progress.  It's interfaces and functionality are subject to change.
      </p>

      <p>The currently supported serialization formats are VOTable and FITS. XML serialization might be included in future versions.</p>

      <p>A Spectral Energy Distribution is represented by the {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.Sed} class. In the current implementation, this class provides methods to access
        and manipulate a list of {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.Segment} objects, each segment being the representation of a Spectrum or a collection of Photometry points.</p>

      <h3>Seds Input/Output</h3>
      <p>A {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.Sed} object can be read from a file using the Sed class itself. For example, the following code
          reads the <code>sample.vot</code> VOTable from disk and performs very basic error handling:</p>

      <pre><code>
      Sed sed;

	try
	{
	    sed = Sed.read("sample.vot", SedFormat.VOT);
	}
	catch (SedParsingException ex)
        {
            System.err.println("Parsing Error: "+ex.getMessage());
        }
        catch (SedInconsistentException ex)
        {
            System.err.println("Inconsistency Error: "+ex.getMessage());
        }
        catch (IOException ex)
        {
            System.err.println("I/O Error: "+ex.getMessage());
        }
      </code></pre>

      On the other hand, to write the {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.Sed} object <code>sed</code> to disk in a given {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.io.SedFormat}, e.g. FITS:

      <pre><code>
      try
	{
	    sed.write("sed.fits", SedFormat.FITS);
	}
	catch (SedWritingException ex) {
            System.err.println("Error writing sed: "+ex.getMessage());
        }
      </code></pre>

      <h3>Exceptions and error handling</h3>
      <p>
          Note that all the Sed*Exceptions have a common ancestor: SedException. If you don't want to catch all the specific exceptions on a one-by-one basis, you can
          safely catch the SedException once.
      </p>

      <p>
          However, Sed*Exceptions provide a finer grained semantics to the underlying errors, allowing a better error handling, especially when building
          user interfaces.
      </p>

      <p>
          For example, when trying to add a segment to a SED, the client might want to inform the user that the segment is not compatible with the other ones in the SED, asking
          the user what action to take (ignore the segment, add it to a different SED, visually inspect it, etc.).
      </p>

      <h3>API description</h3>
      <p>The library also provides a collection of Java classes that map to the
        datatypes defined in the schema.</p>

      <p>SED documents (in various file
        formats) can be read by the library and the corresponding Java objects
        instantianted.  These objects can then be modified as desired - which
        is equivalent to editing the document - and the results written as a
        modified document.  The library API can also be used to create
        documents by instantiating the appropriate Java objects
        directly.
      </p>

        <p>
        The library can be used to transform SED documents from one file
        format to another by reading the document, which builds the
        appropriate Java
        object(s) and then writing it out in another format.
        </p>
        <p>
        The API also provides access to the spectral data in a document. This
        permits, for example, plotting of the data, statistical analysis of
        multiple spectra, or fitting theoretical models to the data.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Compatibility among Segments</h3>
        <p>
            When a {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.Segment segment} is added to an SED, a compatibility check is performed in order to have a consistent SED. For more information,
            please refer to the {@link cfa.vo.sedlib.Segment#isCompatibleWith(cfa.vo.sedlib.Segment other) isCompatibleWith} method documentation.
