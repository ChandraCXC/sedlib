      <p>Test Cases with following the pattern Test*IO exercise the ability of the library of creating, reading and writing
          Sed objects according to the SED Data Model. In this sense, they cover Test Cases 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.
      </p>
      <p>
          Additional test cases have been designed for more complex data files and for exercising error handling for
          test cases 4.2 and 4.3, and they are included in
          TestCase4_2 and TestCase4_3.
      </p>
      <p>
          For these test cases, as well as for TestCase5, each method is documented with a
          description of the specific feature tested.
